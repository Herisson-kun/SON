## Guitar Tuner - Signal Processing Project

### Overview
This project aims to develop a guitar tuner using signal processing techniques implemented in C++. The tuner will analyze the input audio signal from a guitar and provide real-time feedback on the pitch accuracy.

### Features
- Real-time audio input processing
- Fast and accurate pitch detection
- User-friendly interface for visualizing detected pitch

### Dependencies
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)

### Installation
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub: [https://github.com/Herisson-kun/SON/]
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the source code using the provided Makefile or CMakeLists.txt.

### Usage
1. Run the compiled executable file.
2. Play a string on your guitar.
3. The tuner will analyze the input signal and display if the detected pitch is higher or lower than the correct frequency.
4. Adjust the tuning of your guitar based on the feedback provided by the tuner.

### Configuration
- Adjust the threshold for pitch detection.
- Modify the FFT parameters for better frequency resolution.
- Customize the graphical user interface (if applicable).
